        <section>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Kleydert Cardona Cata√±o, my friends called me "Mierdert",
            because i suck playing video games online with them hahahahahahahaha. I was Born
            on 1984 36 years ago and working like a slave about 18 years. I got
            bored with my life when one Sunday I was working while my friends
            were playing games or going out on dates with their loves, So I
            decided to return to the academy and become a great engineer and
            create a better future for myself. I love Music so much!! play it,
            feel it... it's the best of the life. Actually i'm studying my
            pregrade in Systems Engineer and i live it. It's hard to do when you
            are working and studying at the same time, but i'll bever give up
            with out figth and win out of course. I really like go outside and
            walk on the nature mountains, rivers, streams, etc. But my time is
            low, so i can't did it all the time like i want.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to be a great Engineer, make a greats codes in my future
            work. Focusing in AI, Data Science, Machine learning and why not,
            make my own video game and sell them to all.
          </p>

          <h3 id="mydesing">My work experience</h3>

          <p>
            I Worked in Costume Service so virtual as physically in the last 6
            years in 3 differents companies. I also worked on the family
            business about 6 or 7 years, is this last one I was the logistics
            manager and I was a school teacher for 4 months and it was the best
            job I have ever had. I'm a great coworker, when you are honest,
            dedicated, responsible, respectful, ambitious, funny, caring, etc.
            getting a good work environment is simple and this describes me a
            lot.

            Dont be Afraid. 
            
            <p>He is one of the best comedians I have ever seen.
              One day I was listening to music on YouTube, I wanted to listen to a
              string quartet and the search engine suggested "Yayo and the worker
              quartet", in my innocence I thought it was a string quartet where
              they met after their construction work or something like that , but
              no and I didn't know what to expect. It is about a hidden camera
              that they make to an international guest, where the language used by
              Yayo is very explicit and macho, as well as being direct and
              irritable ... just great !!! I cried with laughter for several
              minutes and from there I became more of a lover of black humor.</p>
